### Hides your SteamID from the F2 (ConnectPanel) window as well, even if you are admin. Meant for people who stream, roleplay, or just don't want it to show in content where they share their screen.

`Install on all clients and the server. Client and Server needed (so it can periodically check admin)`

`This mod uses a file watcher.
If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly, upon file save, it will update immediately`

Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will compare the version from the server and the clients
version. If the client is a different version, it will kick them
from the server.
File watcher so you can change directly in the config file the client side setting of "Hide My SteamID Also" and it live
updates.
The client configuration for admins "Hide My SteamID Also" is on by default. Change that in the config file or via
BepInEx Configuration Manager.
